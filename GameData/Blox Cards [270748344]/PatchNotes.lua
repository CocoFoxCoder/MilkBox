<b>Executive Changes</b><br/>	<i>From Myrmiredon, head of the ACGD</i><br/>	
		<i>The following changes are from the head designer.</i><br/>

<b>Celestials</b><br/>	<i>Total group rework</i><br/>	
		<i>This group has been a significant design nightmare. Designed for splexit, this group needing huge life totals makes games take a long time and create linear, binary gamestates; Either they have the huge life and win, or got Aggro"d T3 and lose. We would like to print powerful lifegain cards, such as melvin, without worrying if that upset the balance of this group as fixed life requirements are entirely dependent on how easily reachable they are. Thus, the Celestial group has been reworked in order to open up design space in GB.</i><br/>


<br/>Celestial Remnant: Reworked. Now âšª 1000/100. Effect now "Overload. Whenever this card attacks: Until your next end step, it gains power equal to the amount of life you"ve gained this turn."
<br/>Celestial of Sun: Now âšªâšª (-ðŸŸ¢). Now gives a fixed 100 depower when cast. No longer generates when cast.
<br/>Celestial of Moon: Now âšªâšª (-ðŸ”µ). No longer generates when cast.
<br/>Celestials of Time and Space: Reworked. Now ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ. "If you have more than 6000 life, you lose that much life and draw four cards. Otherwise, you gain 1000 life. Give yourself a Celestial Remnant."
<br/>Celestials of Life and Death: Reworked. Now ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ. "You gain 300 life. A target enemy fighter loses power equal to the amount of life you"ve gained this turn. Give yourself a Celestial Remnant."
<br/>Celestials of Chaos and Fate: No longer gives life. Rather than losing its colourless cost if you have a set amount of life, now loses it if you have gained 1000 or more life.
<br/>Celestials of Night and Day: Instead of its requirement needing a fixed life total, now requires 10 Celestials in your Graveyard to be cast. Now ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ (+ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ). Now gains 2000 life (From 500)

<b>Toys</b><br/>	<i>Total group rework</i><br/>	
		<i>I"ll be blunt: Toys are a splexit design that was incredibly lame. They were so lame that no one played them for over two years since their last iteration, which is a problem when that iteration was trivially overpowered. This complete overhaul removes the Splexity rot from this group.</i><br/>

<br/>Toy Truck: Reworked. Now âšªâšª 400/400. "Whenever you cast a Toy: Lock this card for 1 turn. Then if it has 5 or more locks, unlock it and recur an allied Toy card."
<br/>Toy Teeth: Reworked. Now âšªâšª 900/100. "Whenever you cast a Toy: Lock this card for 1 turn. Then if it has 5 or more locks, unlock it and you gain two colourless studs."
<br/>Toy Car: "Now âšªðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ 350/350. Whenever you cast a Toy: Lock this card for 1 turn. Then if it has 5 or more locks, unlock it and a target fighter."
<br/>Toy Remote: Reworked. Now âšª. "Lock a target allied figher for 1 turn. It gains 100 Power for each lock it has, but can"t gain more than 500 Power this way."
<br/>Toy Jet Fighter: Reworked. Now ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ 500/500. "Whenever you cast an action: Lock this card and a target allied fighter for 1 turn. Then if this card has 5 or more locks, unlock it and all allied fighters gain 100 Health and Power."
<br/>Toy Plane: Reworked. Now âšªðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ 600/400. "Haste. Whenever a fighter dies: Lock this card for 1 turn. Then if it has 5 or more locks, unlock it and draw a card."
<br/>Call of the Teddy Bear: Reworked. Now 5ðŸŸ¡. "Fading. Recur all allied Toy cards. Destroy them if they"re not cast by their next end step."
<br/>Toy Boss Dino: Reworked. Now 6ðŸŸ¡ 1500/1500. "This card can"t counter. Whenever you cast a Toy: Lock this card for 1 turn. Then if it has 8 or more locks, unlock it and steal a target enemy fighter."
<br/>Toy Train: Now 250/250 (+100/+100). Now buffs by 100/100 (from 200/200) per trigger.

<br/>Ultimate Doregriffon: Instead of summoning a clone, now gives you two colourless fighter cards.
Juan2184: Now statted 500/500 (+0/+100)
<br/>Mydadisaguest: Reworked. Now âšªâšªâšªâšª 400/400. "When this card is cast: Select a card in your hand. Remove a Green stud from it, or four if you"ve ever cast a fighter onto a full board this game."
