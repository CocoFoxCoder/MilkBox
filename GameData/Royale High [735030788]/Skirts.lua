Her breath resembled fog in the frosty air as she swiftly sprinted, her full circle, tea-length skirt twirling as she swooshed around the bend. The fabric of this dress was as versatile as a dancer should be, able to be lengthened or shortened, she knew how effortfully exquisite it was, & how it'd be squandered on someone who did not comprehend how to properly employ it. She could always brush away the white shards of snow falling from its form, but this chance wasn't so assured, what if she never heard this music again? She stopped, eyes fixated on the bloke's back.
'Excuse me!'
A voice called, her thoughts barely catching up with the fact that it was her own. The gent looked over his shoulder.
'It's you.'
He stated.
Nose scrunching up, her eyebrows furrowed.
'What?'
He blinked. A beat passed between them.
Clearing his throat, the sides of his lips curled up sheepishly.
'It's rude to stare.'
Opening her mouth to speak, she closed it, fretting over seeming like just another slippery sardine crammed into the cityscape.
'That‚Äî'
What are you doing, December?!
'Song in the shop. I was wondering if a fellow such as you is clever enough not to pass up on the opportunity to partake in a dance with a lady.'
Eyes widening, he broke into a laugh, shaking his head as snowflakes fluttered past his face.
'A dance?! Ma'am, it is below zero. You'll break your neck on the sleet. Besides, I was taught not to talk to strangers.'
Haughtily, she placed her hands on her hips.
'I recall things better with a dance, & I am exemplary at my craft on any surface & no matter the weather! Perhaps I shall find a proper gentleman to assist a lonesome lady.'
Pausing, the man's head shifted. He didn't know her, but the possibility of her potentially putting herself in harm's way toyed with his morals... Begrudgingly, he trudged towards her.
'Alright. Where to, then?' (written by stixxntricks)]],

Gasping, her heart swelled with gratefulness... This is a flawless recreation of her signature skirt! Layered & topped with a bow, although this was handcrafted by dressmakers, not beasts of the forest! Versatile as a quick-thinking royale, this garment has multiple toggles; 1st is the original, 2nd is to remove the fur trim, 3rd turns into a shorter snow party skirt, & 4th into a ruffle party skirt!

(Tale of Triumph, Part 3) 

Demise came quickly. Days later, a farmer plucks a fresh cauliflower only for it to crumple to ashes within his grasp. A knight finds the bridge he takes during his patrol collapsed into the stream below. Park trees tumble & crack into soot, one after another. The king pushes away his paling meals, feeling defeated by the dreary world around him. The pigeons left first, then the alleyway foxes, then cattle vanished from their fields. Dogs barked ominously at the air, as if they could sense its taint. The affliction came without cause or reason, but left no stone unturned. Later that week on the night of the golden harvest moon, instead there hung a sad, waning moon in a starless sky. The statue of their serene Goddess stood, though she had lost some of her usual beauty due to lack of upkeep. The doodled dove beneath her feet had grown tired of its seemingly endless battle in the mortal world. Children peeking out from behind their curtains hoped it had flown away to happier places. They felt worried that the statue now grew useless without anyone taking care of it, or visiting it, for the dove was her last remaining friend. (written by stixxntricks)]],

Created with felt stitching, you may mistake their scarlet bracts for bona fide flora, but they're in reality stunningly crafted replicas. This choice was accepted with consideration in mind to the delicate poinsettias; they likely wouldn't survive such a cumbersome & strenuous journey!

Although she confesses baking will always remain her bread & butter, the decision was hardly in poor taste. She claims she had the idea while live on the air, crafting a fondant coated cake of a regal dress encircling a doll for a birthday party recipe; she thought the design was just too delectable to eat!
